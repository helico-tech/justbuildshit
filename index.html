    <h1>Just Build Shit Manifesto</h1>
        <section>
            <p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of <em>ideas, principles, annoyances, and brainfarts</em> on developing software in order
                to remind me, and maybe even some other people, on how to actually <em>deliver software</em> and <em>improve as a developer</em>.</p>
            <p>Almost all the points below are, or have been, applicable to myself. I am not some all-knowing programming saint. This is, if anything, a mirror to hold up to myself.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day we <em>just want to build shit</em>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <dl>
                <dt>No Ego-Driven-Development</dt>
                <dd>Absolutely nobody cares that you used a recursive descent parser in a pure functional immutable way in order to read a config file.</dd>
                <dd>If you want to show off your programming prowess, do not burden your team members with your unintelligable results. In the best case you'll
                get push-back from team members that you should change it, resulting in double work.
                In the worst case people actually believe you are a programming god and won't dare to question you.</dd>
                <dd>Also, you won't understand your own glorious creation a few months down the road when inevitably bugs arise and only you are the programming god that can solve them. Which you aren't.</dd>

                <dt>Don't abstract a future you don't know</dt>
                <dd>Don't design architectures or code for all the possible usecases that might arise in the future. You don't know the future.</dd>
                <dd>When you start duplicating code, and it proves painful, abstract. Don't abstract because you duplicated code, once.</dd>

                <dt>Just because a framework, library, or ecosystem is old means it does not mean it is bad</dt>
                <dd>It means that it has stood the test of time, and it has seen a lot of usage.</dd>
                <dd>That cannot be said of the latest VC funded micro-SSR-turbo-framwork with Go-compiler-pipeline and flashy website.</dd>

                <dt>Tools are a means, not a goal</dt>
                <dd>It is super great that you are fluent in NeoVim and write tons of macros for it. Just learn it in your own time.</dd>
                <dd>Learn a tool that works for you, stick with the tool.</dd>

                <dt>Your identity is not your stack</dt>
                <dd>Your are not a React dev, or a Rust dev, or a Spring developer. You are a builder.</dd>

                <dt>Learn the basics of what your new favorite framework abstracts</dt>
                <dd>When using full stack frameworks with ORM's and SSR and whatnot try to learn what they abstract. SQL? HTTP? Caching? Auth?</dd>
                <dd>Nothing has fundamentally changed in most foundations of software development. The new shiny framework is just a new iteration of the basics.</dd>
                <dd>You'll find out that most stuff is made complicated by frameworks precisely because they want to abstract every possible usecase of every user in the future.</dd>

                <dt>Code will always be messy</dt>
                <dd>Even with guidelines, and standards, code will be messy because communicate messy.</dd>
                <dd>Learn to cope with messiness.</dd>
                <dd>Do not propose a rebuilt because stuff is messy. You will create a new mess. Instead, tidy up when you can.</dd>

                <dt>Don't overinflate your scale</dt>
                <dd>Chances are your app is not Netflix/Shopify/CashApp/whatever. Solve the real problem in front of you. Not the imagined future where your app scales to a billion users with a plugin system written in WASM.</dd>
                <dd>We are not in the 90's anymore. Hardware is fast. Fast enough for 99% of usecases.</dd>

                <dt>Rewriting is ego, not progress</dt>
                <dd>Wanting to do a rewrite is often ego, or insecurity, talking.</dd>
                <dd>If you do not understand a codebase, you also do not know what to rebuild.</dd>
                <dd>Instead, try to gradually fix the pain points.</dd>

                <dt>The 10x engineers on Twitter/YouTube/whatever</dt>
                <dd>If their livelihood depends on Twitter/Youtube/whatever they have a different agenda then you.</dd>
                <dd>The "stack I am going to use for 'my next Saas'" short is for clicks. Building 1 fullstack TodoList app isn't a SaaS.</dd>
                <dd>A SaaS is a multiyear commitment including maintenance and support.</dd>
